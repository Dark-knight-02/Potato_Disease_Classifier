# Potato_Disease_Classifier
Potato disease classifier using Convoloutional Neural Networks

Early Blight & Late Blight  are the two main diseases seen in potato plants.  The dataset we use has the images of healthy, early blight and late blight affected leaves.(Dataset taken from Kaggle)

The data available was cleaned and preprocessed using tf dataset and Data augmentation.

The model was built using CNN in tensorflow.

Future plans : Built a website in React JS and apply the model there, Create an Image generator API, Deploy the model to GCP, Build a mobile app in React native and apply the model in it to classify the images recorded in the mobile camera.
